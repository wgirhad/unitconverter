# unitconverter
Small pygtk unit converter

This is one of the very first pieces of software I've written back in 2012, even
though I finished my first programming course in 2007, I don't have any backups
from that time and I really only started taking it seriously around 2011-2012.

There's some dangerous noobie mistakes in this code, like using eval() to parse
arithmetic formulas in order to convert between the units. But I'm not changing
it, since this repository is just a nostalgia dump from an old hard drive
I've found.

## How to use it

Just `python3 unitconverter.py` then mess around with the inputs
